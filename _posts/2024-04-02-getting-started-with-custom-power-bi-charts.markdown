I have co-written a [getting started guide](https://sep.com/blog/level-up-your-data-with-custom-power-bi-charts/) on how to create custom charts using Power BI. I posted the article on my employer's blog, so head over there to read the post. You will learn how to create your own custom chart and hook it up to a data source within Power BI. 

One nice feature about Power BI is that it not only provides standard out-of-the box chart types like bar, line, and pie graphs, but it also provides a way to create your own visualizations from scratch using TypeScript / JavaScript libraries like Highcharts and D3. The [article](https://sep.com/blog/level-up-your-data-with-custom-power-bi-charts/) dives into how to get started creating your own custom visual that can be exactly what you need it to be.

But, you may be asking "What is Power BI?" Well, here's quick intro...

Businesses rely on data as an input to decision making. Questions like: How many widgets should we order? What areas of our business should we invest in next year? How can our historical data help predict future behavior and performance? The ability to answer such business questions benefits greatly by having rich, accurate, and up-to-date data that is easy to comprehend. The easier it is to see the meaning within the data, the easier it will be to gain insights about your business.

One great way to surface that meaning is to visualize the data through graphs and charts. A tool like Excel can be helpful for this, but what if your data is updated regularly day-by-day, hour-by-hour, or minute-by-minute? What if you want to share the visuals with an entire team as a live dashboard? Excel isn't as well-suited for that, but a tool like [Power BI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi) provides such capabilities.

Power BI is part of Microsoft's [Power Platform](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform), which includes Power Apps, Power Automate, Power Pages, and Dataverse. They form an integrated collection of low-code tools that businesses can use to automate their processes and gain insights from their data. These tools also integrate with Microsoft's Azure and Fabric as well, so the Power Platform offers a lot of flexibility for businesses to pick and choose what components work best for them.
