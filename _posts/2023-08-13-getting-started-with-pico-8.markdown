As a follow-up to [my last post](https://www.jeremyjarvis.net/2023/08/12/pico-8.html), I have written up [a guide](https://sep.com/blog/explore-game-development-with-pico-8/) for how to get started with Pico-8. Making your own video game may seem like a daunting and unfamiliar idea, but it turns out that tools like Pico-8 make it easier than ever to try out game development for yourself.

I posted the article on my employer's blog, so head [over there](https://sep.com/blog/explore-game-development-with-pico-8/) for a step-by-step guide. I will show you where to get Pico-8, and the basics of creating your first game.
