## Personal Projects

[**Applitools Demo**](https://jeremy-jarvis.github.io/applitools-demo) - A walk-through of how to use [Applitools](https://applitools.com/) with Cucumber, Protractor, and Chai to verify the visual appearance of Angular apps. I've had good success using Applitools, and want to share what I have learned. [My walk-through](https://jeremy-jarvis.github.io/applitools-demo) is a micro-course on how these tools can be used together to create an awesome verification testing setup, and [my example repo](https://github.com/jeremy-jarvis/applitools-demo) demonstrates the result of that process.

## Recent Professional Experience

**QA / Test Lead for a Regulated Medical App** - My team was responsible for verifying a data visualization portal, built using [Angular](https://angular.io/). My role involved requirements analysis, test planning, tool qualification, test implementation, requirements coverage and traceability. We developed automated verification tests, automated visual tests (using [Applitools](https://applitools.com/)), and wrote a few manual testing procedures.

**Fleet Management Portal** - I was part of a small team that developed a [React](https://reactjs.org/) app for tracking and optimizing the usage of heavy machinery across an entire fleet. See [this overview](https://sep.com/our-work/case-study/heavy-machine-monitoring-app/) for a lot more details.

**Race Car Aerodynamic Modeling** - I was part of a small team that developed an app to model the aerodynamic properties of a race car, such as downforce and drag. We were able to quickly turn around a solution that met our client's goals, and helped them win! Built using C# and WPF. See [this overview](https://sep.com/our-work/case-study/aerodynamic-modeling-and-simulation-application/) for a lot more details.
