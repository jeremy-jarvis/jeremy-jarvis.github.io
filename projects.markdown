## Personal Projects

[**Applitools Demo**](https://jeremy-jarvis.github.io/applitools-demo) - A walk-through of how to use [Applitools](https://applitools.com/) with Cucumber, Protractor, and Chai to verify the visual appearance of Angular apps. I've had good success using Applitools, and want to share what I have learned. [My walk-through](https://jeremy-jarvis.github.io/applitools-demo) is a micro-course on how these tools can be used together to create an awesome verification testing setup, and [my example repo](https://github.com/jeremy-jarvis/applitools-demo) demonstrates the result of that process.

## Recent Professional Experience

**Solo Tester for a Mobile Medical Website** - I created a new test strategy from the ground up and built verification and integration test suites for the entire system, including automated and manual test scripts. I crafted the test suites to serve both the client's quality policies and the technical constraints of the product. Achieved 100% requirements coverage. Test tools I used included [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and [Applitools](https://applitools.com/).

**Test Lead for a Medical Web App** - I verified a data visualization portal, built using [Angular](https://angular.io/). My role involved requirements analysis, test planning, tool qualification, test implementation, requirements coverage and traceability. I developed automated verification tests, automated visual tests, and wrote a few manual testing procedures. My role involved leading other testers, reviewing their code, and coordinating our efforts to meet quality and timeline expectations.

**Fleet Management Portal** - I was part of a small team that developed a [React](https://reactjs.org/) app for tracking and optimizing the usage of heavy machinery across an entire fleet.

**Race Car Aerodynamic Modeling** - I was part of a small team that developed an app to model the aerodynamic properties of a race car, such as downforce and drag. We were able to quickly turn around a solution that met our client's goals, and helped them win! Built using C# and WPF. See [this overview](https://sep.com/our-work/case-study/aerodynamic-modeling-and-simulation-application/) for a lot more details.
