![Me](/assets/images/avatar-icon.jpg){: .image-right-with-margin } 
I'm a Senior Software Engineer with more than [16 years](https://twitter.com/wwwsepcom/status/1631756219395321856?s=46) of experience. I strive to build quality software that makes a meaningful impact.

I have worn various hats during the course of my career: Software Engineer, Test Lead/Engineer, and Project Lead.

During a [recent project](/projects) I built a slick web app using a modern tech stack including [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [FormKit](https://formkit.com/). I developed the UI from the ground up, bringing to life our client's vision of centralizing and streamlining their business processes. Our client stakeholders were impressed by what we built, and were excited by how our app would transform the way they work.

I also recently built a proof-of-concept app using [Power BI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi) and the Microsoft Power Platform. I created custom visualizations using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/). Our proof-of-concept validated platform assumptions, which reduced risks and gave our client confidence in the planned architecture. 

Before that, I led software verification for a smart home system and a series of medical apps. My role as Test Lead involved analyzing requirements, developing test plans and strategies, and building automated test suites using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/). I am proud of what I accomplished to serve the clients' quality expectations, technical constraints, and timelines.

Take a look at [projects](/projects) I have worked on.

Prior to my career as a software engineer, I was in charge of Information Technology and Marketing for a non-profit organization that provides medical services to disadvantaged people (3+ years).
