![Me](/assets/images/avatar-icon.jpg){: .image-right-with-margin } 
I'm a Senior Software Engineer with more than 15 years of experience and a focus on software testing. I build and test quality software that makes a meaningful impact on our world.

I have worn various hats during the course of my career: Test Lead, Test Engineer, Software Engineer, and Project Lead.

For several years I have led the verification effort for a series of medical web apps. My role as Test Lead has involved requirements analysis, test planning, test implementation, requirements coverage and traceability. I am proud of the work I have done to develop test suites that serve both the client's quality expectations and technical constraints.

Take a look at [projects](/projects) I have worked on.

Prior to my career as a software engineer, I was in charge of Information Technology and Marketing for a non-profit organization that provides medical services to disadvantaged people (3+ years).
