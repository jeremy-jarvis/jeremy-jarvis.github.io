I'm a Senior Software Engineer with more than 13 years of experience in a variety of domains. My focus is on building quality software that makes a meaningful impact on our world.

I have worn various hats during the course of my career: Software Engineer, Project Lead, Test Lead, and Test Engineer.

Recently, I led the verification effort for a regulated medical app. My role as Test Lead involved requirements analysis, test planning, test implementation, requirements coverage and traceability.

Take a look at various [projects](/projects) I have worked on.
