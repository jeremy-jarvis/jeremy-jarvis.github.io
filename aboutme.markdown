I'm a Senior Software Engineer with more than 17 years of experience in a variety of domains. My focus is on building quality software that makes a meaningful impact on our world.

I have worn various hats during the course of my career: Test Lead, Test Engineer, Software Engineer, and Project Lead.

For several years I have led the verification effort for a series of medical web apps. My role as Test Lead has involved requirements analysis, test planning, test implementation, requirements coverage and traceability. I am proud of the work I have done to develop test suites that serve both the client's quality expectations and technical constraints.

Take a look at [projects](/projects) I have worked on.
