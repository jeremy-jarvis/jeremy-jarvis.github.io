![Me](/assets/images/avatar-icon.jpg){: .image-right-with-margin } 
I'm a Senior Software Engineer with more than [16 years](https://twitter.com/wwwsepcom/status/1631756219395321856?s=46) of experience. I strive to build quality software that makes a meaningful impact.

I have worn various hats during the course of my career: Software Engineer, Test Lead/Engineer, and Project Lead.

I recently built a proof-of-concept system using Power BI and the Microsoft Power Platform. I created custom visualizations using TypeScript and Highcharts. Our proof-of-concept validated platform assumptions, which reduced risks and gave our client confidence in the planned architecture. 

Before that, I led software verification for a smart home system and a series of medical apps. My role as Test Lead involved analyzing requirements, developing test plans and strategies, and building automated test suites. I am proud of the work I did to serve the clients' quality expectations, technical constraints, and timelines.

Take a look at [projects](/projects) I have worked on.

Prior to my career as a software engineer, I was in charge of Information Technology and Marketing for a non-profit organization that provides medical services to disadvantaged people (3+ years).
