![Me](/assets/images/avatar-icon.jpg){: .image-right-with-margin } 
I have over [17 years](https://twitter.com/wwwsepcom/status/1631756219395321856?s=46) of experience in delivering software solutions that delight my clients. My years at SEP has given me a multitude of experiences on a wide array of projects, products, and domains. My wide range of experience makes me a great fit for handling whatever challenges come my way. I've championed roles in software leadership, development, and testing. If you want a lead / software engineer whose skills have been refined by years of experience, I'm your man.

Take a look at [projects](/projects) I have worked on.

I have worn various hats during the course of my career: Project Lead, Software Engineer, and Test Lead/Engineer.

Over the last 11+ months, I have been leading a software development team that consistently achieves our client's goals. We have successfully built and deployed a production system that is being used by thousands of employees across a large organization to manage and assess employee skills. In my role as team lead, I work closely with client stakeholders to understand, define, and refine features and their acceptance criteria. I guide and support my development team in our effort to build the next right thing to meet our client's evolving needs. We are building the app using: [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

During a recent project, I built a slick web app using a modern tech stack including Vue.js, TypeScript, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [FormKit](https://formkit.com/). I developed the UI from the ground up, bringing to life our client’s vision of centralizing and streamlining their business processes. My client stakeholders were impressed by I built, and were excited by how the app would transform the way they work.

I also recently built a proof-of-concept app using [Power BI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi) and the Microsoft Power Platform to ingest data and render custom visualizations using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/). Our proof-of-concept validated platform assumptions, which reduced risks and gave our client confidence in the planned architecture.

I have been developing with JavaScript / TypeScript for over seven years. In the past, I have served in Test Lead/Engineer roles, where I planned and implemented the testing strategies for entire projects. This included writing automated end-to-end test suites, leveraging testing tools like [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), Cucumber, Appium, and Applitools.

Prior to my career as a software engineer, I was in charge of Information Technology and Marketing for a non-profit organization that provides medical services to disadvantaged people (3+ years).
