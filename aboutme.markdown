![Me](/assets/images/avatar-icon.jpg){: .image-right-with-margin } 
I'm a Senior Software Engineer with more than [15 years](https://twitter.com/wwwsepcom/status/1631756219395321856?s=46) of experience. I build and test quality software that makes a meaningful impact on our world.

I have worn various hats during the course of my career: Software Engineer, Test Engineer, Test Lead and Project Lead.

I have recently led software verification for a smart home system and a series of medical apps. My role as Test Lead has involved analyzing requirements, developing test plans and strategies, and building automated test suites. I am proud of the work I have done to serve my clients' quality expectations, technical constraints, and timelines.

Take a look at [projects](/projects) I have worked on.

Prior to my career as a software engineer, I was in charge of Information Technology and Marketing for a non-profit organization that provides medical services to disadvantaged people (3+ years).
